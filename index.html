                <p class="about-p">Third Eye Cleaning & Lifestyle Services is a Toronto based cleaning company owned and operated by Taylor Marie.  Taylor started Third Eye Cleaning in August 2019 after the cleaning company she had been working for, Miss Jay’s, decided to close.  Taylor was fortunate to have been given the opportunity to take on all of Miss Jay’s clients as her own, and thus her own company was born.  Taught by her Portuguese mother and grandmother, Taylor understood the meaning of a spotless home from a young age, and she brings this understanding to each and every home and business that she and her team cleans.  Taylor values integrity, reliability, and a commitment to consistently good work.</p>
