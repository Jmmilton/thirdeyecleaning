    <p>During this pandemic, we are taking extra precautions to keep you and your family or business, as well as ourselves and our communities, as safe as possible from coming into contact with COVID-19.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Our safety protocol is as follows:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Before your appointment you will be asked if you or anyone in your home or business is experiencing any symptoms or if they have been sick within the past 2 weeks</li>
        <li>Before each visit our cleaners will take their temperature and ensure they do not have any symptoms. If they have a raised temperature or any symptoms, we will cancel the appointment immediately or send a cleaner who does not have symptoms and who has not come into contact with the other cleaner in the past 2 weeks</li>
        <li>We always wear a mask and gloves inside your home or business (changing gloves frequently)</li>
        <li>We always keep a 6ft distance from you or anyone present in the space</li>
        <li>We open windows during our visit to ensure a better airflow and thus a lower chance for any potential virus to stay present in the air</li>
        <li>We always maintain a high standard of cleanliness and understand the importance of being thorough (especially during this time)</li>
        <li>We always disinfect all surfaces and touch points after they have been cleaned (we use hydrogen peroxide which is a proven, non-toxic disinfectant effective against COVID-19)</li>
        <li>We actively social distance and maintain a high standard of cleanliness in our personal lives outside of work</li>
    </ul>
